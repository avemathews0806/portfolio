                <p>I am a creative and enthusiastic developer interested in IT and everything in its orbit. I recently began to be fascinated by web programming, e.g. developing apps and building websites. As a front-end developer, I love being able to solve
                    logical problems while still keeping a creative style-based mindset. I am looking for a company willing to offer me a placement among their developers. I believe my skills and passions for coding and design will be a great addition
                    to any team.</p>
